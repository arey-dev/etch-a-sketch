### What I learned
During this project, I learned some of the important principles when dealing with **Events** in javascript: **Bubbling, Capturing, and Event Delegation**. 

### Continued Development
 My understanding of how Javascript events work got better because of this project. But there are still a lot of events to know and practice. I plan on continuing my journey on The Odin Project, and practice what I've learned so far.
